# LinkedIn Clone MERN

A simplified LinkedIn-like social network built with the **MERN** stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node). This repository contains a full-stack example demonstrating common features found in professional social networks: user authentication, profiles, posts with media, likes/comments, connections, and notifications.

> ⚠️ This project is intended for learning and demo purposes only. It is **not** production hardened — do not use it to store real user data without adding security, validation, and compliance checks.

## Database models (overview)

Example Mongoose models you might have:

- **User**: _name, email, passwordHash, headline, location, about, experience\[], education\[], skills\[], avatarUrl, connections\[]_
- **Post**: _author (User ref), text, mediaUrl, likes \[User refs], comments \[{ author, text, createdAt }], createdAt_
  **ConnectionRequests**: _sender (User ref), receiver (User ref), status \[pending|accepted|rejected], createdAt, updatedAt_
- **Notification**: _user (recipient), type, payload, read, createdAt_

## Authentication & Security notes

- Passwords should be hashed using `bcrypt` (never store plain text).
- Use HTTPS in production and set secure cookies if you switch to cookie-based auth.
- Validate and sanitize user input to prevent XSS/NoSQL injection.
- Limit file upload size and validate file types if accepting images.

---

## Testing

Add unit and integration tests with Jest and Supertest for the backend and React Testing Library for the frontend. Example commands:

```bash
# server
cd server
npm test

# client
cd client
npm test
```
